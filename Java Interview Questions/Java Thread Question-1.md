## Interviewer: Can you explain the difference between synchronized and volatile keywords in Java?


That's correct, but let's add a bit more detail for clarity:

- **synchronized**: This keyword ensures that only one thread at a time can access the synchronized block or method. It is used to prevent concurrent access issues by acquiring a lock on the object or class.

- **volatile**: This keyword ensures that the value of a variable is always read from and written to the main memory, not from a thread's local cache. It guarantees visibility of changes to variables across threads.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed explanation of the `synchronized` and `volatile` keywords in Java:

### `synchronized` Keyword

**Purpose**: 
The `synchronized` keyword in Java is used to control the access of multiple threads to shared resources. It ensures that only one thread can execute a block of code or method at a time.

**How it works**:
- When a thread enters a synchronized block or method, it acquires a lock associated with the object or class.
- Other threads attempting to enter a synchronized block or method on the same object or class are blocked until the lock is released.
- This prevents race conditions and ensures thread safety.

**Usage**:
1. **Synchronized Method**:
   ```java
   public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
       // critical section code
   }
   ```
   - The method is synchronized on the instance (object) lock.

2. **Synchronized Block**:
   ```java
   public void someMethod() {
       synchronized (this) {
           // critical section code
       }
   }
   ```
   - The block is synchronized on the instance lock.

3. **Static Synchronized Method**:
   ```java
   public static synchronized void staticSynchronizedMethod() {
       // critical section code
   }
   ```
   - The method is synchronized on the class lock.

**Example**:
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

### `volatile` Keyword

**Purpose**: 
The `volatile` keyword in Java is used to ensure the visibility of changes to variables across threads. It prevents threads from caching variables locally and forces them to read/write from/to the main memory.

**How it works**:
- A volatile variable is read from and written to the main memory.
- This guarantees that any thread reading the variable will see the most recently written value.
- It addresses visibility issues but does not guarantee atomicity.

**Usage**:
```java
public class VolatileExample {
    private volatile boolean flag = false;

    public void setFlag() {
        flag = true;
    }

    public boolean isFlagSet() {
        return flag;
    }
}
```

**Example**:
```java
class SharedData {
    private volatile boolean running = true;

    public void stop() {
        running = false;
    }

    public void run() {
        while (running) {
            // perform task
        }
    }
}
```

### Comparison

- **synchronized** ensures mutual exclusion and visibility, providing a stronger guarantee by allowing only one thread to execute the synchronized block/method at a time.
- **volatile** ensures visibility of variable updates, but does not provide atomicity or mutual exclusion.

### When to Use:

- Use `synchronized` when you need to control access to critical sections of code to ensure that only one thread can execute them at a time.
- Use `volatile` when you need to ensure that changes to a variable are visible to all threads but do not need atomicity or mutual exclusion.

By using these keywords appropriately, you can manage thread synchronization and visibility issues effectively in Java.
