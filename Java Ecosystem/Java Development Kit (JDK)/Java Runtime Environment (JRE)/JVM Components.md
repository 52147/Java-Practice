### Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java.

#### JVM Components

- **Class Loader**: Loads class files into the JVM.
- **Bytecode Verifier**: Checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access rights to objects.
- **Interpreter**: Executes the bytecode instructions line by line.
- **Just-In-Time Compiler (JIT)**: Compiles bytecode into native machine code for faster execution.
- **Garbage Collector**: Manages the memory by reclaiming memory used by objects that are no longer referenced.
