#### Thread Lifecycle

- **New**: When a thread is created but not yet started.
- **Runnable**: After calling `start()`, the thread is ready to run and waiting for CPU time.
- **Blocked/Waiting**: When the thread is waiting for a resource or another thread to perform a task.
- **Timed Waiting**: When the thread is waiting for a specific amount of time.
- **Terminated**: When the thread has finished execution.
