// The try block contains code that might throw an exception.
// The catch block handles the exception.
// The finally block contains code that will run regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught. It is typically used for cleanup activities.

try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Code to handle the exception
} finally {
