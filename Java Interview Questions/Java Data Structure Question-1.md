## Can you describe the difference between HashMap and TreeMap in Java?
That's a good explanation. Here's a bit more detail:

- **HashMap**:
  - Implements the `Map` interface.
  - Does not guarantee any order of its elements.
  - Provides O(1) time complexity for insertion and retrieval.
  - Internally uses an array of buckets, where each bucket is a linked list (or tree structure in case of high collisions).

- **TreeMap**:
  - Implements the `NavigableMap` interface.
  - Maintains a sorted order of its elements according to their natural ordering or a specified comparator.
  - Provides O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and access.
  - Internally uses a Red-Black Tree to maintain order.

TreeMap is useful when you need a map that is sorted, whereas HashMap is preferable for general-purpose use due to its constant-time performance for basic operations.
