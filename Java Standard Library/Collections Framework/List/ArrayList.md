The Java Collections Framework provides a set of classes and interfaces to manage and manipulate groups of objects. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the main components:

### List
A `List` is an ordered collection (also known as a sequence). Lists can contain duplicate elements.

- **ArrayList**
  - **Description:** Resizable array implementation of the List interface.
  - **Performance:** Fast random access and iteration. Slow insertion and deletion in the middle of the list.
  - **Use Case:** When you need fast access to elements using an index and don't need to insert or delete elements frequently.
