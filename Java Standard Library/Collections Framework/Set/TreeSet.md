- **TreeSet**
  - **Description:** Navigable set implementation based on a TreeMap.
It stores elements in a sorted order, meaning that it maintains the elements in ascending order by default. The sorting order can be customized using a comparator provided at the time of the set's creation.
  - **Performance:** Sorted order, but slower access, insertion, and deletion compared to HashSet.
  - **Use Case:** When you need a sorted set.


NavigableSet
The NavigableSet interface in Java is a subtype of the SortedSet interface that provides additional navigation methods to retrieve elements based on their values relative to given elements. It extends the functionality of a SortedSet by providing methods to navigate the set in a more flexible way.
