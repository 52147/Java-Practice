The `override` keyword and the `super` keyword serve different purposes in Java, and they address different needs in object-oriented programming. Understanding their distinct roles helps clarify why both are necessary and useful.

### Override

The `@Override` annotation in Java is used to indicate that a method in a subclass is intended to override a method in its superclass. This annotation serves several purposes:

1. **Documentation**: It makes the intention of the developer clear, indicating that a method is meant to override a method in the superclass.
2. **Compile-time Checking**: The compiler checks that the method actually overrides a method in the superclass. If it doesn't (due to a typo in the method name or incorrect parameters), the compiler will generate an error.

#### Example:
```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `@Override` annotation indicates that `makeSound` in `Dog` overrides `makeSound` in `Animal`. This ensures that any calls to `makeSound` on a `Dog` object will use the `Dog`'s implementation.

### Super

The `super` keyword is used to access members (methods or variables) of the superclass that have been hidden by members of the subclass. This allows a subclass to call the superclass version of a method or constructor. This is useful when the subclass method wants to enhance or modify the behavior of the superclass method rather than completely replace it.

#### Example: Accessing Superclass Methods
```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        super.makeSound(); // Calls the superclass method
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

In this example, `super.makeSound()` is used to call the `makeSound` method of the superclass `Animal` within the overriding method in the subclass `Dog`. This allows the `Dog` class to add additional behavior (barking) while still retaining the original behavior (making a sound) from the `Animal` class.

#### Example: Accessing Superclass Constructors
```java
class Animal {
    Animal() {
        System.out.println("Animal is created");
    }

    Animal(String name) {
        System.out.println("Animal named " + name + " is created");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog() {
        super(); // Calls the default constructor of the superclass
        System.out.println("Dog is created");
    }

    Dog(String name) {
        super(name); // Calls the parameterized constructor of the superclass
        System.out.println("Dog named " + name + " is created");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `super()` and `super(name)` calls in the `Dog` constructors are used to invoke the corresponding constructors in the `Animal` class. This ensures that the `Animal` part of a `Dog` object is properly initialized before the `Dog`-specific initialization occurs.

### Why Not Just Use Override?

Using only `@Override` would limit the ability to:
1. **Combine Behaviors**: Sometimes you want to enhance or extend the behavior of the superclass method rather than completely replace it. Using `super.methodName()` allows you to include the superclass behavior in addition to the subclass behavior.
2. **Ensure Proper Initialization**: When dealing with constructors, `super()` ensures that the superclass part of an object is properly initialized before the subclass's constructor adds its own initialization steps.

### Summary

- **@Override**: Used to indicate and ensure that a method is overriding a method from the superclass. It is mainly for documentation and compile-time checking.
- **super**: Used to access superclass methods and constructors. It allows combining behaviors (by calling the superclass method) and ensuring proper initialization (by calling the superclass constructor).

Both are necessary for different aspects of method overriding and inheritance in Java.
