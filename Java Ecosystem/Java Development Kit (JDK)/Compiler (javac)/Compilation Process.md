### Java Development Kit (JDK)

The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed for Java development.

#### Compiler (javac)

The `javac` tool reads class and interface definitions written in the Java programming language and compiles them into bytecode class files.

##### Compilation Process

1. **Source Code**: The programmer writes source code in `.java` files.
2. **Compilation**: The `javac` compiler converts the source code into bytecode, which is stored in `.class` files.
3. **Bytecode**: The bytecode is a platform-independent, intermediate representation of the source code.

Example:
```bash
javac MyProgram.java
```
