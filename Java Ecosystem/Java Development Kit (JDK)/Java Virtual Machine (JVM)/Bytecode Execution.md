#### Bytecode Execution

The JVM interprets the compiled bytecode and executes it on the host machine. This process involves:

- **Instruction Fetch**: Fetches the next bytecode instruction to execute.
- **Instruction Decode**: Decodes the bytecode instruction to understand what operation is to be performed.
- **Instruction Execute**: Executes the decoded instruction.
